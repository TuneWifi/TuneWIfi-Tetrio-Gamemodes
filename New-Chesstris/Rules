**Old Rule:**
Max fouls are 2, fouls last one round and is reset back to 0 every new round
1 foul removes 3 minutes off the clock on that round, reaching 2 will lose you that round
losing the round by foul will DISQUALIFY you from first turn priority
for the standard set, 10 minutes is placed and is reset per new game round
if your timer runs out, you lose the round but keep turn priority
for the 1st round, timer will only begin after the first bag, the one who goes first will have their clock started

**RANKED Rule:**
Max fouls are 3, but fouls last for the entire match
1 foul removes 3 minutes off the clock on that round, reaching 3 instantly loses you the match
for the standard set, 10 minutes is placed and is reset per new game round
if your timer runs out, you lose the round and turn priority
for the 1st round, timer will only begin after the first bag, the one who goes first will have their clock started
